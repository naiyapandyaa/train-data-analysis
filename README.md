🚆 Train Delay Analysis Project | Cognifyz Technologies Internship 

This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my Data Engineering internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The project involved analyzing real-world railway data to identify patterns and insights related to train delays.

📁 Tasks Included:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Data Transformation & Aggregation
4. Data Visualization using Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
5. Report Generation & Insights

📊 Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

📌 Dataset: Railway_info.csv (provided by Cognifyz)

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with real data, improving my skills in data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization. 🚀
